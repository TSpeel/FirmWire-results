# V-D Vulnerabilities

This directory contains my add-ons to the results at https://github.com/FirmWire/ndss22_experiments/tree/main/V-D_vulnerabilities
The crashes directory contains the original RRC crashes, as well as an example crash from my fuzzing campaigns on RRC. You can run the repro_G973_asba.py script with argument RRCTBD and observe that the raw assembly that is printed equals the assembly for crash RRC1.
Note that the script requires the same setup as with the original scripting.
